knowledge base chat agent for mbr services specialists to assist at call center Knowledge Graph–Based GraphRAG architecture:

This project creates a Graph Rag on Medi-Cal, IHSS documents, and hundreds of text files scraped from the Knowledge Base. Each of these docs and text files are nodes in the graph rag.

Knowledge Graph Building: Triples are used to build a directed graph . Triples are (Subject, Predicate, Object) e.g., (Insulin, treats, Diabetes). Nodes = entities, edges = relationships.

Hybrid Retrieval: A user question triggers: Graph-based retrieval: Find relevant triples (structured knowledge). Vector-based retrieval: Find semantically similar chunks. Both are merged into a context string. Both meaning: Context (Triples + Text Snippets(vectors)) and Question. Both of these are fed into LLM to get answer.

Step by Step process:

Scrape the entire Knowledge Base (KB) by running scrape3.py. Scraped data will be saved to project dir -- data/kbcontents.
Pre-Process all the text files generated by 1. and remove the table of contents and other unnecessary texts running pp_text.py
Run clean.py to remove dup second URL (same as first URL except second URL contains "print") rendering second url as useless
Run app4.py
Run rename_files.py so we have more content suggestive text files names
